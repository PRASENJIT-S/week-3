    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
         be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
         and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
         <br>

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
         multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
          for its appearance.
          <br>

          <br>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
         interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
          by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
          <br>

          <br>
           HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input  directly 
           introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and p surround and provide information about document
            text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content
             of the page.</p>

            <h1>What is semantic HTML?</h1>
            <p>Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain
                <br>

                <br>
                Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in web pages
                 and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by
                  traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents.
